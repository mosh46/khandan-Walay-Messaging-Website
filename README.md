# khandan-Walay-Messaging-Website
I created this website because i want to create a messaging web app for my family which should be very easy for the users, in which users should not need to sign in to message they should just enter the room name and password and start chatting.
I choose a PHP as backend because it is very easy to communicate with backend in PHP.

This website is hosted on https://khandanwalay.ml/
